            <p class="paragraph">From November 2023, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, or
                ETIAS,
                will come into effect.
                Lithuania is one of the countries in Europe that will require travellers to have ETIAS authorisation
                to
                enter visa-free.<br><br>
                Foreign citizens from visa-exempt countries who travel to any country in the Schengen Area
                for business or leisure must apply for an ETIAS Travel Authorisation once the system is in effect.
                A Lithuania ETIAS will also be valid for travel within the other countries in the system.<br><br>
                The principal reason for the introduction of the Europe travel permit ETIAS is to improve security
                within the borders of Europe as a whole. However, the online ETIAS application is designed to be a
                simple and efficient process.<br><br>

        <div class="text">
            <p class="paragraph">German roads are excellent and driving around the country can be a lot of fun.
                The country’s pride and joy is its 6800-mile (11,000km) network of autobahns (freeways).
                About every 30 miles, you’ll find elaborate service areas with gas stations, bathrooms and restaurants,
                and
                many are open 24 hours.
                In between are rest stops (Rastplatz), which usually have picnic tables and bathrooms. <br><br>
                Autobahns are supplemented by an extensive network of Bundesstrassen (secondary "B" roads, highways) and
                smaller Landstrassen (country roads).
                No tolls are charged on public roads.
                If your car is not equipped with a navigational system, having a good map or road atlas is essential,
                especially when negotiating the tangle of country roads. <br><br>
                Navigating in Germany is not done by the points of the compass, meaning that you’ll find no signs saying
                "north" or "west." Rather, you’ll see signs pointing you in the direction of a city, so make sure you
                have a
                map.<br><br>
            </p>

        <div class="headline">By Train</div><br> <br>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="paragraph">Germany has an extensive network of long-distance and regional trains with frequent
                departures.
                They are fairly expensive, but deals are often available,
                especially if you book in advance. Germany’s rail system is operated almost entirely by Deutsche Bahn,
                whose website has detailed information in English and other languages, as well as a ticket-purchasing
                function. Flixtrain offers low-cost journeys on a handful of routes. <br><br>
                Tickets for Deutsche Bahn trains may be bought using a credit card up to 10 minutes before departure at
                no
                surcharge. You will need to present a printout of your ticket, as well as the credit card used to buy
                it, to
                the conductor.
                Smartphone users can register with Deutsche Bahn and download the ticket via the free DB Navigator app.
                Tickets are also available from vending machines and agents at the Reisezentrum (travel center) in train
                stations. The latter charge a service fee but are useful if you need assistance with planning your
                itinerary.<br><br>
                Tickets sold on board incur a surcharge and are not available on regional trains. Agents, conductors and
                machines usually accept debit cards and major credit cards. With few exceptions (station unstaffed,
                vending
                machine broken), you will be fined if caught without a ticket.

        <div class="headline">By Boat</div><br><br>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="paragraph">Considering that Germany abuts two seas and its interior is filled with lakes and
                rivers,
                don’t be surprised to find yourself in a boat at some point.
                For basic transport, ferry boats are primarily used when travelling to or between the East Frisian
                Islands
                in Lower Saxony;
                the North Frisian Islands in Schleswig-Holstein; Helgoland, which also belongs to Schleswig-Holstein;
                and
                the islands of Poel,
                Rügen and Hiddensee in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania.<br><br>
                Scheduled boat services operate along sections of the Rhine, the Elbe and the Danube rivers.
                There are also ferry services in river sections with no or only a few bridges,
                as well as on major lakes such as the Chiemsee and Lake Starnberg in Bavaria and Lake Constance in
                Baden-Württemberg.

        <div class="headline">By Plane</div><br><br>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="paragraph">Flying in Germany is only useful for longer distances.
                Unless you’re flying from one end of the country to the other, say Berlin to Munich or Hamburg to
                Munich,
                planes are only marginally quicker than trains once you factor in the time it takes to get to and from
                airports. <br><br>
                The German government is also starting to encourage travelers to skip short-haul flights in favor of the
                train. Most large and many smaller German cities have their own airports, and numerous carriers operate
                domestic flights within Germany. Lufthansa has the densest route network.
