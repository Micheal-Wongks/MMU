                <span>Germany, officially Federal Republic of Germany, German Deutschland or Bundesrepublik Deutschland,
                    country of north-central Europe, traversing the continent’s main physical divisions, from the outer
                    ranges of the Alps northward across the varied landscape of the Central German Uplands and then
                    across the North German Plain.<br><br>

                    One of Europe’s largest countries, Germany encompasses a wide variety of landscapes: the tall, sheer
                    mountains of the south; the sandy, rolling plains of the north; the forested hills of the urbanized
                    west; and the plains of the agricultural east. At the spiritual heart of the country is the
                    magnificent east-central city of Berlin, which rose phoenixlike from the ashes of World War II and
                    now, after decades of partition, is the capital of a reunified Germany, and the Rhine River, which
                    flows northward from Switzerland and is celebrated in visual art, literature, folklore, and song.
                    Along its banks and those of its principal tributaries—among them the Neckar, Main, Moselle, and
                    Ruhr—stand hundreds of medieval castles, churches, picturesque villages, market towns, and centres
                    of learning and culture, including Heidelberg, the site of one of Europe’s oldest universities
                    (founded in 1386), and Mainz, historically one of Europe’s most important publishing centres. All
                    are centrepieces of Germany’s thriving tourist economy, which brings millions of visitors to the
                    country each year, drawn by its natural beauty, history, culture, and cuisine (including its
                    renowned wines and beers).<br>

                    <span>German history can be divided into the following time periods:</span>
                    <span>Charlemagne established the First Reich of the German Empire.
                        He was known for his military prowess –prior to Charlemagne the Slavic tribes had gradually
                        pushed
                        their territories westward;
                        Charlemagne stopped this progression, expanded the Germanic territories, and brought them under
                        German rule.
                        Culturally the German Empire was divided into the Germanic and Slavic areas.
                        These cultural nuances were evident in the dialect and naming practices.
                        In the 16th century there was also a consonant shift in the German dialect. In the North,
                        Plattdeutsch, or Low German was spoken.In the South, Hochdeutsch, or High German was spoken.<br>
                        <br>
                        Germany was a conglomerate of nobility areas including kingdoms, provinces, duchies and
                        principalities.
                        In 1789 there were over 1,700 independent German States. Germany did not exist as a “nation”
                        until
                        1871.
                        Social standing defined one’s rights and obligations in pre-1900 German society. The belief
                        system
                        was the Nobles were to protect,
                        the Clergy were to pray and the Peasants were to work. Your station was believed to be
                        determined by
                        God and therefore unchangeable - upward mobility was almost impossible.
                        Farmers were tenants rather than land owners and feudalism empowered those who owned the land.
                        The
                        largest landowners were the nobility and the clergy.
                        As landowners, the Manor Lord was responsible for protecting his serfs. In return for
                        cultivating
                        the land, the serfs were obligated to provide to the Manor Lord: labour, produce, military
                        service
                        and taxes.
                        As serfs, they could not marry, change occupations, or move without the permission of their
                        Lords.
                        Feudalism existed in some parts of Germany up until WW I.

                <div class="text">
                    The birthplace of the modern printing press and of influential schools of philosophy and artistic
                    styles, Germany has long played an important role in Western culture, and the arts have been central
                    to Germany’s idea of itself. Indeed, the historian Hagen Schulze observed that the German nation was
                    born in the minds of the intelligentsia, as a cultural entity without direct
                    ties to politics. It was therefore only logical that its great heroes were not princes and military
                    leaders as in France and England but rather a collection of poets and philosophers.…Germany’s
                    extraordinary cultural flowering made it the new Greece, said both Friedrich von Schiller and
                    Wilhelm von Humboldt—powerless but intellectually supreme.

                    That ideal fell only when the German nation began to experiment with power and expand militarily,
                    but it remains fondly held by contemporary German intellectuals as a model worthy of emulation in a
                    new Europe.<br><br>

                    During the period of partition, West Germany, as heir to Germany’s older regions, was custodian of
                    the greater portion of the country’s rich cultural legacy. The majority of Germany’s architectural
                    monuments—of Roman Germany and of the medieval Romanesque and southern German Baroque styles—fell
                    within its borders, as did many of the great libraries, archives, and facilities for the performing
                    arts. Yet some of the greatest monuments of German cultural and historical achievement were located
                    in East Germany, including the Wartburg of Martin Luther, the Weimar of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
                    and the Leipzig of Johann Sebastian Bach; a large share of prewar Germany’s art treasures also
                    rested in East Germany, especially in East Berlin and Dresden. After the division of Germany, many
                    of the cultural assets originally from the eastern sector were removed to the West or to Russia,
                    which generally refused to return them after unification. For example, it is estimated that some
                    200,000 works of art were taken from Germany after World War II, and German sources estimate that
                    more than 4.6 million books were taken; Russian holdings include a Gutenberg bible and thousands of
                    works from the Berlin Museum’s East Asian collection. Nonetheless, some materials, such as a
                    stained-glass window from the Marienkirche in Frankfurt, have been returned. Many of East Germany’s
                    artists, writers, and institutions, including entire publishing houses, relocated to West Germany or
                    set up successor organizations there.<br><br>

                    Despite the political division, the German cultural and artistic tradition remained identifiably the
                    same. In the German-speaking world, a writer or painter or composer or playwright or sculptor was
                    German whether holding a passport from the Federal Republic or from the Democratic Republic.
                    Moreover, in art and literature the adjective deutsch (“German”) has no strict political boundaries.
                    For example, the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, the Czech novelist Franz Kafka, the Romanian poet
                    Paul Celan, and the Swiss playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt all are considered “German” because their
                    work falls within the German cultural tradition.<br>

                <div class="text">
                    <span>Though the groundwork was laid by many, the Protestant Reformation officially
                        began in 1517 when Martin
                        Luther posted his 95 Theses on the doors of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. Several wars came
                        about
                        as various rulers
                        embraced differing religious views. The conflict ended 1648 at the close of the Thirty Years’
                        War
                        through the Peace of Westphalia.
                        Many Lutheran parishes began keeping records around 1540.</span>

                <div class="headline">The Council of Trent and Counter Reformation<br>1545-1563</div>
                <div class="text">
                    <span>In response to the rapid growth of Protestantism, the Catholic Church convened the Council of
                        Trent to clarify
                        Church doctrine and establish Church policies. The Council was held in three periods consisting
                        of 25 sessions,
                        spanning almost 20 years. In session 24, it was decreed that a record must be kept of marriages
                        and church sacraments,
                        resulting in the keeping of Catholic parish registers around 1564. Another part of the Counter
                        Reformation in the 1550’s involved
                        pressuring many noble lords to control heretics within their jurisdictions. This resulted in the
                        imprisonment,
                        torture and death of Protestants. Thousands of non-conformists migrated, sometimes hundreds of
                        miles, to areas where they were allowed
                        religious freedom.</span>

                <div class="headline">The Peace of Augsburgbr<br>1555</div>
                <div class="text">
                    <span>The Peace of Augsburg was the treaty between Charles V and an alliance of Lutheran Princes
                        granting legal
                        status to the Lutheran religion within the Holy Roman Empire. The Peace established Cuius regio,
                        eius religio,
                        “Whose realm, his religion”. The religion of the ruler dictated the religion of his subjects.
                        Subjects who did not
                        agree with the specific Prince’s decision were granted a period of time in which to move to
                        another
                        nobility
                        jurisdiction to worship as they chose. Calvinist and Anabaptist groups living under the rule of
                        a
                        Lutheran or Catholic
                        Prince found themselves in danger of being charged with heresy. Cuius regio, eius religio
                        represented a subtle shift
                        in power and went against the previous Catholic teachings that the king should faithfully obey
                        the
                        Pope.
                        The new decree placed the religious leaders, to a degree, into a position of subjection to the
                        will
                        of the rulers.
                        The Peace of Augsburg was shattered by the Thirty Years’ War.

                <div class="text">
                    <span>The Thirty Years’ War was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history.
                        The land was ravaged; homes, churches, and crops were destroyed. In Baden, one-half of all
                        the buildings were razed, with its population forced to live in caves. Famine and disease
                        followed the devastation and nearly one-third of the population of Germany died. In the
                        Palatinate, it is estimated that only 50,000 of the original one million inhabitants survived.
                        Population shifts occurred. Swiss immigrants settled in the decimated areas of Baden and the
                        Pfalz. Youth were encouraged to marry young in order to work the land and re-populate the
                        country. The Peace of Westphalia officially ended the Thirty Years’ War. The Reformed Church
                        (Calvinism) received legal status as a state religion.

                    <span>The Napoleonic occupation wrought changes in German rule and record keeping,
                        though most only remained in effect while Napoleon was in power. Napoleon enforced separation of
                        Church and State and by 1806 had dissolved the Holy Roman Empire. He abolished serfdom in the
                        areas he conquered and implemented civil registration – once again separating the affairs of
                        Church and State. The French Republican Calendar was in use from 1792 to 1805. Most of
                        Napoleon’s
                        changes were reversed upon his defeat. Serfdom was reinstituted in many areas of Germany and
                        civil registration was not mandated on a national level until 1876, (though in many areas the
                        local governments saw value in reporting birth, marriage and death records and required clerics
                        to submit a yearly copy of their church registers). The Gregorian calendar replaced the French
                        Republican Calendar by 1806. Napoleon’s reign ended at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

                        II Empress of Russia opened areas within Russia for German colonisation. During the American
                        Revolution the Hessians fought for England and the Palatines fought for the Colonies. Many
                        soldiers remained in America or were given land grants in Canada. In 1781 Joseph II of Austria
                        opened the area of Galicia for German colonisation and provided for religious tolerance of
                        Protestants. As a consequence, thousands of families, mostly from the Palatinate, immigrated
                        to Galicia and settled in newly-founded German-speaking communities in the country or as
                        craftsmen in the cities.

                <div class="text">
                    <span>Some influences upon emigration after 1800 were mass production and overpopulation.
                        The Industrial Revolution began in the 1830’s in Germany, though it was not until the 1870’s
                        and 1880’s that it truly succeeded. A population shift occurred in Germany. People who a
                        generation before had earned their living off the land flooded the larger cities to work in
                        factories. Mass manufacturing threatened individually handcrafted items and goods. Political
                        changes also affected internal emigration and immigration. The repeated calls for freedom,
                        democracy and unity from the middle and upper class led to the failed Revolution in 1848. Faced
                        with the choices of imprisonment or death, many of the educated and skilled middle class
                        emigrated from Germany to America and other countries. In the 1700’s in many states in Germany
                        it was illegal to immigrate. By the 1820’s immigration was legalised and in the 1840’s-1850’s
                        many areas, on a governmental level, encouraged the emigration of the poor. The improvement
                        in the conditions, cost and modes of travel had a positive effect. The voyage to America
                        became more convenient and less expensive. By the mid-1890’s the number of immigrants
                        decreased and internal mass migrations within Germany increased. Of all of the ports used by
                        German emigrants, only the Hamburg Passenger List, post-1850, has survived. Fragments of
                        records of other ports have survived.

                        in retaliation, escalating into the First World War. After its defeat in 1919, Germany was
                        summoned to Versailles to sign the peace treaty. There were a total of 440 clauses in the final
                        treaty, 414 clauses spelled out Germany's punishment - the severity of which resulted in
                        widespread German economic collapse.

                    <span>The German Revolution in 1918-1919 finally ended serfdom and feudalism in Germany. A
                        parliamentary
                        republic was established called the Weimar Republic. The new republic was plagued by debt
                        incurred
                        in the Treaty of Versailles and Hyperinflation between the years of 1921-1923. In the early
                        1930’s
                        the Depression spread. By 1932 over three million Germans were out of work. The conditions in
                        post
                        World War I Germany were economically desperate - an advantage to Adolph Hitler and his rise to
                        power. Hitler promised a stronger, brighter Germany.

                    <span>In 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. He quickly eliminated his government
                        partners
                        and established Germany as an authoritarian state and himself as Dictator. In direct defiance of
                        the
                        Treaty of Versailles, Hitler rebuilt the German military and sought world domination through
                        military power. He also desired to purge Germany of all he deemed to be “undesirable.” In 1939 a
                        nationwide census was taken, predominantly focusing on Jews and other minorities. The term
                        Holocaust
                        is used to define the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II.

                        toll was between 11 and 17 million.

                        It was divided among the Allied Forces France, Britain, Russia and the United States. By the end
                        of
                        World War II, most of the German population fled or was expelled from areas outside the
                        territory of
                        post-war Germany and post-war Austria. It is estimated that between 12 and 14 million ethnic
                        Germans
                        and their descendants were displaced from their homes. By 1949 the Allied forces relinquished
                        control over the United Zones to the parliamentary democracy of West Germany. Russia retained
                        control of East Germany under the dictatorship of Stalin. In 1961 a concrete barrier, the Berlin
                        Wall, was built to divide East Berlin from West Berlin. After protests within East Germany, the
                        Peaceful Revolution resulted in the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In 1990 the “Two Plus Four”
                        Treaty was negotiated between the German Democratic Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of
                        Germany and the Four Powers occupying Germany. The Four Powers renounced any rights they
                        formerly
                        held in Germany, and Germany agreed to not attempt to regain pre-World War I boundaries. The
                        Reunification of Germany was officially 13 Oct 1990.
