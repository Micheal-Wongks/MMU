            <p class="">German food is rich, hearty and diverse. It's comfort eating with high-quality, often locally
                sourced ingredients.
                The cuisine of Germany has been shaped not only by the country's agricultural traditions but by the many
                immigrants that have made the country home over the centuries.
                It's definitely more than a mere mix of beer, sauerkraut and sausage.<br><br>
                Today Germans appreciate well-prepared, well-served meals as much as they do a quick bite on the go.
                This is
                a country of food markets, beer gardens, wine festivals, food museums and high-end restaurants.
                We have made a list of some dishes tourists need to try when they travel to Germany.</p>

                <p>There is no Germany without sausages. There are countless cured, smoked and other varieties available
                    across wurst-loving Germany, so, for this list we will focus on some of the best German street food:
                    bratwurst, or fried sausages.There are more than 40 varieties of German bratwurst. Fried on a
                    barbecue
                    or in the pan, and then served in a white bread roll with mustard on the go, or with potato salad as
                    the
                    perfect accompaniment for German beer.<br><br>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Germany’s version of pasta, spätzle, is made from a simple yet exquisite combination of eggs, flour,
                    salt and a splash of sparkling water. Originating from Baden-Württemberg, this tasty dish is
                    traditionally served as an accompaniment to meat dishes or used to hearten up soups. This simple
                    side dish can be transformed into something mighty with the simple addition of Emmental or Swiss
                    cheese.<br><br>

            <div class="text">
                <p>You’d be forgiven for thinking schnitzel is Austrian rather than German, but what you might not know
                    is that this breaded meat dish actually originated in Italy. While the Austrian ‘Wiener Schnitzel’
                    is by law only made with veal, the German version is made with tenderised pork or turkey, and is a
                    staple of most traditional German restaurants.

                <p>Claimed by both France and Germany, the flammkuchen hails from the Alsace region, which in the past
                    has been a dispute between the two countries. A sort of German pizza, flammkuchen is a
                    thinly-rolled, rectangular shaped bread dough traditionally topped with crème fraîche, thinly sliced
                    onions and lardons. Finished by being baked in an oven, this delightful delicacy packs a comforting
                    yet delicious salty punch that’ll leave you wanting more.<br><br>

                <p>This isn’t technically a foodie dish, but we couldn’t write a food guide to Germany without mention
                    of the nation’s favourite beverage. Beer, or bier as the Germans call it, even has its own festival
                    – Oktoberfest runs each September and celebrates all things beer for around two weeks. As the
                    birthplace of lager, most German beers are held to the Reinheitsgebot (the German Beer Purity Law)
                    that originated in the sixteenth century.<br><br>

            <div class="text">Restaurant Atelier Gourmet is a popular eatery that serves French cuisine, and a few
                European dishes as well. One of the most popular eateries among locals and travellers, this cosy
                restaurant gets very busy during dinner hours. Because it is so popular and usually has a long line
                of people waiting to get in, guests are expected to leave as soon as they finish their meal.
                Nevertheless, Restaurant Atelier Gourmet is among the must-visit restaurants in Munich
                Germany.<br><br>
