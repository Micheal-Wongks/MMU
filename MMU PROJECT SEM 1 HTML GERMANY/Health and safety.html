        <div class="text">
            You can safely drink tap water in Germany!<br><br>
            Tap water is safe and the most controlled beverage/food product in Germany.
            Many German cities including Berlin and Munich brag about the quality of their tap water which often comes
            from
            the same source as mineral water.
            However, there are also regions where the tap water tastes of chlorine, is high in limescale and people are
            concerned about potential contaminants.
            <br><br>
            If you don't like the taste of tap water or worry about contaminants, then a high quality filter such as
            TAPP
            Water can be a good idea.

            <div>Extremist youth groups have harassed or attacked people for racial reasons or because they seem

            <br>

            <h3>Drink spiking</h3><br>
            <div>Drink spiking can occur at popular nightclubs and markets, often leading to sexual assault.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="list">
