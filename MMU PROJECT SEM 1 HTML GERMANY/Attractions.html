                <p>Modelled on the Acropolis in Athens and built for King Frederick William II in 1791, the
                    monumental
                    sandstone Brandenburg Gate in Berlin's Mitte district was the city's first Neoclassical structure.
                    It
                    measures an impressive 26 metres in height, which includes the Quadriga, the spectacular four-horse
                    chariot carrying the goddess of victory perched atop this spectacular building.<br><br>
                    Its six huge columns on each side of the structure form five impressive passages: four were used by
                    regular traffic, while the center was reserved for the royal carriages. Huge Doric columns also
                    decorate
                    the two buildings at each side of the Gate, once used by toll-collectors and guards.<br><br>
                    Undoubtedly Berlin's most iconic structure, it's hard to believe that the majestic structure you see
                    today was severely damaged during WWII. It was also once part of the infamous Berlin Wall and, for a
                    few
                    decades, was symbolic of the division of Berlin into East and West.<br><br>

            <div class="text">
                <p>The towering Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom), the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Mary, is located on
                    the banks of the Rhine and is undoubtedly Cologne's most impressive landmark. This masterpiece of
                    High Gothic architecture is one of the largest cathedrals in Europe. Construction on this most
                    ambitious building project of the Middle Ages started in 1248 and reportedly took over 600 years to
                    complete.<br><br>

                    As imposing as its façade, the cathedral's magnificent interior covers an area of 6,166 square
                    metres and boasts 56 huge pillars. Above the high altar is the Reliquary of the Three Kings, a
                    12th-century work of art in gold that was designed by Nicholas of Verdun to house the relics of the
                    Three Kings brought here from Milan.<br><br>

                    Other highlights include the panoramic views from the South Towers, the 12th- and 13th-century
                    stained glass in the Three Kings Chapel, and the Treasury with its many precious objects, all of
                    which survived largely intact after WWII. For some of the best vistas over the city and river, climb
                    the 533 steps to the viewing platform in the South Tower. A small entrance fee is required.

                <p>The beautiful Black Forest with its dark, densely-wooded hills is one of the most visited upland
                    regions in all of Europe. Situated in the southwestern corner of Germany and extending 160
                    kilometres from Pforzheim in the north to Waldshut on the High Rhine in the south, it's a hiker's
                    heaven.<br><br>

                    On the west side, the Black Forest descends steeply to the Rhine, crossed by lush valleys, while on
                    the east, it slopes more gently down to the upper Neckar and Danube valleys. Popular spots include
                    Germany's oldest ski area at Todtnau, the magnificent spa facilities of Baden-Baden, and the
                    attractive resort of Bad Liebenzell. Other highlights include the spectacular Black Forest Railway.
                    It's centred on Triberg with its famous falls, and Triberg itself, home to the Black Forest Open Air
                    Museum.<br><br>

                    The best way to catch them all? Grab a map of the Black Forest Panoramic Route, a 70-kilometre
                    driving tour that takes in the very best views over the region, along with its top historic
                    attractions, including stunning castles and numerous medieval towns and villages.

                <p>Berlin's world-famous Museumsinsel, or Museum Island, lies between the River Spree and the
                    Kupfergraben, a 400-meter-long canal off the river. This excellent attraction includes many of the
                    city's oldest and most important museums.<br><br>

                    The heart of this pedestrian-friendly district is the Old Museum. Constructed in 1830, it was
                    designed specifically to exhibit the royal treasures. Soon after, the land behind the museum was set
                    aside for art and the "knowledge of antiquity."<br><br>

                    Between 1843-55 the New Museum took shape, and the National Gallery was added in 1876, along with
                    the Bode Museum, built in 1904 and home to collections of antiquities. Another highlight of a
                    walking tour of these spectacular points of interest is the Pergamon with its recreated historic
                    buildings from the Middle East.

                <p>The quaint old town of Füssen, situated between the Ammergau and Allgäu Alps and a popular alpine
                    resort and winter sports centre, is a good base from which to explore nearby Neuschwanstein
                    Castle.
                    This spectacular old fortress is widely recognized as one of Europe's most famous and
                    picturesque
                    royal castles.<br><br>
                    King Ludwig II of Bavaria built this many-towered and battlement-covered fantasy fortress,
                    famous as
                    the inspiration for Walt Disney's iconic theme park castles, from 1869-86. A variety of tour
                    options
                    are offered, including guided tours of the sumptuous interior taking in the Throne Room, the
                    Singers' Hall – and some of the country's most spectacular views.

                <p>The seat of Germany's government, the Reichstag (Reichstagsgebäude) is once again one of Berlin's
                    most-visited attractions. Constructed in 1894 in Neo-Renaissance style, it infamously burned down in
                    1933 and remained in ruins until after German reunification, when it was rebuilt in its former
                    glory.<br><br>
                    One change that was made was to the building's massive Kuppel, its central dome. Instead of a
                    traditional wood or metal dome, a decision was made to use glass, transforming the space into a
                    major tourist attraction in the process.
                    From here, visitors can enjoy great city views, which are even more dramatic at night. If planning
                    to enjoy the view in the evening, try to catch a spectacular sunset from the on-site Rooftop
                    Restaurant. The Reichstag also makes for a stunning backdrop for summer concerts and light shows.
                    English language guided tours are also available.

                <p>The old Franconian imperial city of Rothenburg is one of the most attractive places to visit on
                    Germany's famous Romantic Road tourist route. Located on the steep banks of the picturesque River
                    Tauber, it's notable for its walls and towers, untouched since the Thirty Years War of 1618.<br><br>

                    This completely preserved, picture-perfect medieval town offers endless charm. One of the most
                    popular things to do in Rothenburg ob der Tauber is to join a walking tour. For those who prefer to
                    be their own guide, get started by picking up a map from one of the tourism offices located in the
                    town.<br><br>

                    There are no end of opportunities to explore, with individual buildings of note including the
                    imposing 13th-century Town Hall (Rathaus) and the wonderful Ratstrinkstube, or Council Tavern, built
                    in 1466 with its interesting clock. Also worth seeing is St.-Georgs-Brunnen fountain, built in 1608
                    near the end of Herrngasse; St. James's Church, with its fine high altar dating from 1466; and the
                    Imperial City Museum.<br><br>

                    Simply walking the old streets past these beautiful buildings is a timeless experience, especially
                    if it involves the Plönlein, one of the town's most picturesque spots. And after all that adventure,
                    end your visit at one of the many fine restaurants dotted around the town.<br><br>

                    If traveling in winter, be sure to include a stop here for the traditional Christmas Market, which
                    draws crowds from across the country and even further afield.<br><br>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Ulm Minster (German: Ulmer Münster) is a Lutheran church located in Ulm, State of Baden-Württemberg
                    (Germany). It is currently the tallest church in the world.The church is the fifth-tallest
                    structure built before the 20th century, with a steeple measuring 161.5 metres (530 ft).<br><br>

                    Though it is sometimes referred to as Ulm Cathedral because of its great size, the church is not a
                    cathedral as it has never been the episcopal see of a bishop. Though the towers and all decorative
                    elements are of stone masonry, attracting the attention of visitors, most of the walls, including
                    the façades of the nave and choir, actually consist of visible brick. Therefore, the building is
                    sometimes referred to as a brick church. As such, it lays claim to the rank of second- to
                    fourth-largest, after San Petronio Basilica in Bologna and together with Frauenkirche in Munich and
                    St. Mary's Church in Gdańsk. The tower however was mainly built from sandstone.<br><br>

                    Ulm Minster was begun in the Gothic architecture of the Late Middle Ages but the building was not
                    completed until the late 19th century after a hiatus of centuries. When work ceased in the 16th
                    century all of the church except the towers and some outer decorations were complete, unlike at
                    Cologne Cathedral, where less than half of the work had been done before construction halted in the
                    15th century.<br><br>

                    Visitors can climb the 768 steps that lead to the top of the minster's spire. At 143 m (469 ft) it
                    gives a panoramic view of Ulm in Baden-Württemberg and Neu-Ulm in Bavaria and, in clear weather, a
                    vista of the Alps from Säntis to the Zugspitze. The final stairwell to the top (known as the third
                    Gallery) is a tall, spiralling staircase that has barely enough room for one person. <br><br>

                <p>In the far west of Germany, bordering Belgium, is this 27,000-acre (11,000ha) sprawl of beech, ash
                    and wild cherry trees, dark blue volcanic lakes and wildflower-speckled plateaus: it is one of few
                    truly wild areas still remaining in Germany. In the south of the park, rare species of orchids bloom
                    in forest clearings, while uncommon birds of prey such as eagle owls and kites can be seen circling
                    in the thermals. Hidden among trees in some parts of the park, “sense benches” invite you to take a
                    moment, stop, lie down and take in the sounds and smells of this extraordinary place.<br><br>

                <p>You won’t have seen the Alps like this before: a vast, 52,000-acre (21,000ha) swathe of rugged
                    limestone peaks, towering over a gem-blue glacial lake. All that and not another soul in sight. Not
                    unless, that is, you’re in the architectural glass box of the National Park Centre, or touring the
                    park with one of the on-site rangers. Otherwise, you’ve got jaw-dropping, fairytale views of
                    sparkling lakes, cloud-scraping peaks and a patchwork of Alpine pastures all to yourself. Watch out
                    for golden eagles, horned ibex and many species of butterfly, which pollinate wild orchids.<br><br>

                <p>The Germanic National Museum in Nürnberg is Germany’s largest museum of art and culture. Its
                    collection spans millennia and includes the usual paintings and sculpture alongside textiles and
                    crafts, weapons, armour and early scientific instruments. If you’re after a one-stop shop for German
                    history, this is the place.

                    The museum is situated in the south of the historic city center between Kornmarkt and Frauentormauer
                    along the medieval city wall. Its entrance hall is situated on Kartäusergasse which was transformed
                    by the Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan to the Way of Human Rights.
